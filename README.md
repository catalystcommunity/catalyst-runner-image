# Runner Image

The Docker image for use in runners in many CI/CD projects.  Should have everything one needs already installed, or it's easy to add.

# Status

This was used with gitlab CI/CD and CircleCI, and is quickly losing favor to Github Actions for anything we can use that for. It is published publicly.
